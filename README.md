# React-Particles-Fade
First Time Working with React

This is created to be my portfolio on my engineering work and photography, and perhaps one day as my front-end portfolio.
I am not familiar with coding yet I will try to upload on weekly basis.

The website will be full of animations. Once the user enters the site, a greetings will fade in, ease for 5 secs, then fade out. <- current stage.
Following by rounting to the main page, with buttons to access the site.

The site will be in a sci-fi theme, with floating buttons and dots. Ideally the buttons will migrate outwards to the edge of the screen, then back to their position 
after routing.

I know its a long way to go but starting somewhere is better than never.
